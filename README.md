"Augenlicht" is an archaic German word for eyesight, literally "eye light". Obviously the eye does not emit actual rays of light, yet the act of visual perception--particularly of shape and colour--is more than a passive, mechanical reaction to stimuli. Human sight consists of an interplay so physiologically and psychologically complex that one could say it is through the "eye's light" that the world is lit, grasped, and understood.
